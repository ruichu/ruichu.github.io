This guide provides detailed information about three carefully selected proposal locations during cherry blossom season in Japan, with specific recommendations for timing, photography considerations, and backup options.

## 1. Chidorigafuchi Park, Tokyo

Chidorigafuchi Park is one of Tokyo's most picturesque cherry blossom viewing spots, featuring hundreds of cherry trees lining a moat of the former Edo Castle. The location offers romantic boat rides through a tunnel of cherry blossoms, creating a magical setting for a proposal.
