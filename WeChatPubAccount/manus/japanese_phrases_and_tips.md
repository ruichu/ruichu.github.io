### General Etiquette

1. **Bowing**: A slight bow is appropriate for tourists. The deeper and longer the bow, the more respect is shown.

   - Keep your voice down in public places, especially on trains
   - Don't eat while walking in public (except in festival areas)
   - Don't talk on your phone on public transportation
   - Stand on the left side of escalators in Tokyo (right side in Osaka)

5. **Pouring Drinks**: It's customary to pour drinks for others, not yourself. Your dining companions will pour for you.

### Onsen (Hot Spring) Etiquette
